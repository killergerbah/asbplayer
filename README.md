# asbplayer

**asbplayer** is a browser-based media player and Chrome extension developed for language learners who learn their target language through subtitled media. With asbplayer, you can:

- **Easily create high-quality, multimedia flashcards** out of subtitled videos.
- **Load text-selectable subtitles onto most video sources**, including streaming sources.
- **Extract subtitles from popular streaming services** like Netflix and YouTube.
- **Seek through subtitles** using a **navigable subtitle list**.
- **Optimize language-learning efficiency** using subtitled videos with **playback modes** like:
    - **Condensed playback**: Only play subtitled sections of a video.
    - **Fast-forward playback**: Fast-forward through unsubtitled sections of video.
    - **Auto-pause**: Automatically pause at the beginning or end of every subtitle.
- **Use customizable keyboard shortcuts** to access most of asbplayer's features.

If you are a non-English native, and would like to help translate asbplayer, join the [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/asbplayer). If your language isn't there, feel free to create an issue to add it on the [issues page](https://github.com/killergerbah/asbplayer/issues).

## User guide

asbplayer's complete user guide is [here](https://docs.asbplayer.dev/docs/intro).

## Getting Started

> [!NOTE]  
> asbplayer is both a subtitle control and flashcard creation tool. If you are not interested in flashcards, and only want to use asbplayer's subtitle features, just follow step 5.

1. Install and set up a dictionary tool for your target language that allows you to do instant lookups. Popular ones are [Yomitan](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/yomitan/likgccmbimhjbgkjambclfkhldnlhbnn) (see [supported languages](https://yomitan.wiki/other/supported-languages/)) and [VocabSieve](https://github.com/FreeLanguageTools/vocabsieve) (tuned for European languages. Works with Asian languages too but doesn't automatically detect word boundaries).
2. Install [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), and create a deck and note type. More details on [Refold's guide](https://refold.la/roadmap/stage-1/a/anki-setup).
3. Install the [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) plugin for Anki.
4. [Configure](https://killergerbah.github.io/asbplayer/?view=settings) asbplayer to create cards via AnkiConnect using your deck and note type.
5. Enhance a video using asbplayer and subtitle files.
    - **For streaming video:** After installing the [browser extension](https://github.com/killergerbah/asbplayer/releases/latest), drag-and-drop a subtitle file into the streaming video you want to mine.
    - **For local files:** Drag-and-drop media/subtitle files into the [asbplayer website](https://killergerbah.github.io/asbplayer).

    You may have to [adjust the subtitle offset](https://docs.asbplayer.dev/docs/guides/subtitle-timing) to get the subtitles in sync.

6. When a subtitle appears that you want to mine, use <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + X</kbd> to open the flashcard creator.
7. Fill in the definition and word fields and then export the card. To fill in the definition field you may use the dictionary you installed in step 1.
